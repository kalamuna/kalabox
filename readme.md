# Kalabox

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY APPROACHING END OF LIFE IN FAVOR OF Kalabox2. IF YOU ARE A BRAVE AND DARING SOUL AND WANT TO HELP US TEST THE LATEST AND GREATEST HEAD OVER THAT WAY!

Kalabox is more than just a local development environment. It's an easy to use, site building
and deployment toolkit for the masses. Advanced webtools now belong to the people.

## Requirements

  * Kalabox has been tested mostly on Mac OS X 10.8 and partially tested on 10.7 and 10.6. It may work on 10.6 or lower. If you try it out on an older OS X version, please share your experience.
  * For now, Kalabox supports 64-bit operating systems only. So if you're on a 32-bit machine, just hang tight, as support is coming soon!
  * Vagrant 1.3.5 and VirtualBox 4.2.18
  * 1GB+ of RAM

  Kalabox dynamically allocates memory to itself based on your available RAM. It needs at least 1GB available to run.

## Installation

1. Double click on the installer.
2. Agree to the terms of service.
3. Rejoice.

NOTE: Apple may warn you that Kalabox is "from an unidentified developer." That's because we're hip with the indie crowd. To get around the warning (until we sell our souls to Apple), either right-click on Kalabox and select "Open," or, if you're tired of Apple's bullshit, follow these directions to disable Gatekeeper.

## Known Issues

The Mac OS X firewall can interfere with the underlying technologies, Vagrant and NFS, that Kalabox uses. Check out these instructions for tips on using Kalabox with your firewall. Please refer to:

## Connecting with Pantheon

All you need is an account and a site on Pantheon. Go to the configure tab, enter your username and password, click back to My Sites and start developing!

If you're interested in interacting with your Pantheon sites directly from the command line, you can use some of the handy Drush commands that come packaged with the Terminatur.

## Troubleshooting Installation

If you installation fails you should post an issue at https://github.com/kalamuna/kalabox/issues. You might also want to check out the Uninstall.tool utility that is packaged with the install DMG. THIS UTILITY CAN WIPE BOTH YOUR VIRTUAL BOX AND VAGRANT INSTALLS, INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY BUILT VMS. AKA BE CAREFUL.
